# Introduction
## What is Python?
Introduce students to coding and Python in particular.
Explain the difference between computer code, a program, and
a programming language like Python.

## What is repl.it?
Introduce students to the repl development environment.
Show them the difference between the editor and the console and
how to run their code using 'Run' button.

## Demonstrate 'Hello World'
Use the repl example to show the Python3 'Hello World' one-liner.

## What is the print function
Explain the usage of the print function and how it outputs a value to the console.

### Exercise
Have students print out a few things to the console like:

```python3
print ("Hello, I'm John")
print ("I am 12 years old!")
print ("My favorite color is blue!")
print ("My favorite food is pizza!")
```

Ensure that they always enclose their strings with quotes.
Further lessons will have them print out non-string values.

## Comments
### Exercise
Have students comment out one of their print statement.
Click run so that they can see that that line of code doesn't execute.
