# Calculations
## Values and Types
Explain the distinction between values and types.

## Integers
Introduce the integer type.

### Exercise
Have students print out a few numbers to the console like:
```python3
print (2)
print (20000000)
print (99999999999999)
```

## Floats
Introduce the float type.

### Exercise
Have students print out a few numbers to the console like:
```python3
print (3.14)
print (2.71)
print (99.99)
```

## Arithmetic Operators
Introduce the four major mathematical operators (+, -, *, /). If they haven't been taught PEMDAS yet, give them a brief explanation
of it, demonstrating that the same rules apply in Python.

### Exercise
Have students print out a few mathematical expressions:
```python3
print (2 + 3)
print (7.3 - 2.3)
print (5 * 1)
print (100.0 / 20.0)
```

Make the expressions more complicated, using parenthesis and multiple operators.
