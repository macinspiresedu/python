# MacInspires Python Curriculum
This repository contains the tentative curriculum for the Python classes for
MacInspires. The repository is seperated into sections, each under its own directory.
Each section has a corresponding README file that describes the lessons and exercises
of that section.

## Objective
After the completion of this course, students will have a cursory level understanding of the Python programming language. Specifically, students will leave the course with a basic understanding of types, variables, selection, lists, loops, functions and classes. If time permits, students will have built a Pong-like game using the Tkinter library.

## Materials
Students will learn core Python concepts and run exercises in the cloud environment provided by [repl.it.](https://repl.it/).
