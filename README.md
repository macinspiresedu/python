# MacInspires Python Curriculum
This repository contains the tentative curriculum for the Python classes for
MacInspires. The repository is seperated into sections, each under its own file.
Each section's markdown file describes the lessons and exercises of that section.

## Objective
After the completion of this course, students will have a cursory level understanding of the Python programming language. Specifically, students will leave the course with a basic understanding of types, variables, selection, lists, loops, functions and classes. 

## Materials
Students will learn core Python concepts and run exercises in the cloud environment provided by [repl.it.](https://repl.it/).
